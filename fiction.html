    <p style="font-size:80%;"><strong>What is Fiction?</strong><br></p></div>
    <p style="font-size:75%;">
        A work of fiction is created in the imagination of its author. The<br> author invents the story and makes up the characters, the plot or<br> storyline, the dialogue and sometimes even the setting. A fictional<br> work does not claim to tell a true story. Instead, it immerses us in<br>
        experiences that we may never have in real life, introduces us to types<br> of people we may never otherwise meet and takes us to places<br> we may never visit in any other way. Fiction can inspire us,<br> intrigue us, scare us and engage us in new ideas. It can help us<br> see ourselves and our world in new and interesting ways.</p>

<h3 style="font-size:90%;">Types of Fiction:</h3>
<p style="font-size:80%;"><strong>Short Story:</strong><br></p>
    <p style="font-size:75%;"> 
        According to the famous short story writer Edgar Allan Poe, a short<br>
        story is a piece of fiction that can be read in one sitting of about<br>
        a half hour to about two hours. Short stories contain between 1,000<br>
        and 20,000 words and typically run no more than 25 or 30 pages.<br>
        Because of their limited length, short stories generally focus<br>
        on one major plot or storyline and a few characters.</p>
        
<p style="font-size:80%;"><strong>Novella:</strong><br></p>
    <p style="font-size:75%;">
        Novellas are longer than short stories and tend to run about 20,000<br>
        to 50,000 words, usually between 60 and 120 pages. Because novellas<br>
        have more room to work with, they typically have a more complex<br>
        plot or storyline and more characters than short stories. Famous<br>
        novellas include Robert Louis Stevenson's The Strange Case of Dr.<br>
        Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and Jack London's The Call of the Wild.</p>

<p style="font-size:80%;"><strong>Novel:</strong><br></p>
    <p style="font-size:75%;"> 
        A novel is a work of fiction that contains over 50,000 words or<br>
        120 pages. Novels are even more complex than novellas, and they<br>
        usually have more than one plot or storyline and many well-developed<br>
        characters. Novels can be as long as their authors want them to be.<br>
        There is no outer limit to their length. In fact, the longest novel<br>
        ever written is a 17th century work that contains over two million<br>
        words and more than 13,000 pages.</p>

    <u><h3 style="letter-spacing: 2px; text-align: center">How to Write Fiction Step By Step</h3></u>
    
     
       <div class="colum">
    <p style="font-size:80%; font-family: Arial Black; letter-spacing: 5px"><strong>2) Establish the stakes early.</strong><br></p>
    <p style="font-size:75%;">
        To be engaging, your fiction needs clear stakes for its characters.<br>
        These don’t have to be world-shattering, but they do need to feel<br>
        important to the characters. Vonnegut once said that “Every character<br>
        should want something, even if it is only a glass of water.” The main<br>
        character needs to want something and be afraid (for good reasons)<br>
        that they won’t get it. Stories that don’t have clear stakes are very<br>
        hard for readers to engage with.</p>

    <div class="colum">
    <p style="font-size:80%; font-family: Arial Black; letter-spacing: 5px"><strong>1) Don’t start too slow. </strong><br></p>
    <p style="font-size:75%;">
        While some writers do start very slowly and let their stories build<br>
        up dramatic tension over time, this requires a level of practice and<br>
        skill that most beginning writers just haven’t developed yet. Fiction<br>
        depends on conflict, and that needs to be set up as early as possible.<br>
        Famous short story writer Kurt Vonnegut once gave this tip: “To heck<br>
        with suspense. Readers should have such complete understand of what is<br>
        going on, where and why, that they could finish the story themselves,<br>
        should cockroaches eat the last few pages.”</p>
        <img src="slow.PNG" width="555" height="222.5">
    </div>
    
    
    <div class="colum">
    <p style="font-size:80%; font-family: Arial Black; letter-spacing: 5px"><strong>4) Get an idea of some sort.</strong><br></p>
    <p style="font-size:75%;">All books start from a small idea, dream or<br>
        inspiration that is slowly transformed into a larger and more<br>
        detailed version of that same idea. The idea should be something<br>
        you're interested in, something that’s really important to you;<br>
        if you're not passionate about it, that will come through in your<br>
        writing. A good writer is also a good reader and a good observer.<br>
        Make observations about the world around you that you may want to<br>
        incorporate into your fiction</p>
        <img src="idea.PNG" width="555" height="222.5">
    </div>
    
    <div class="colum">
    <p style="font-size:80%; font-family: Arial Black; letter-spacing: 5px"><strong>3) Avoid exposition-heavy dialogue.</strong><br></p>
    <p style="font-size:75%;">
        Dialogue needs to sound natural for the characters speaking it.<br>
        Think about it: When was the last time that you gave your entire<br>
        backstory in a speech to someone you’d just met? Or recapped<br>
        everything that happened in a previous encounter, in detail, in<br>
        a direct address to a friend? Don’t have your characters do that<br> either.</p>
        <img src="dialog.PNG" width="555" height="269.25">
    </div>
    
    <div class="colum">
    <p style="font-size:80%; font-family: Arial Black; letter-spacing: 5px"><strong>6) Finalize your fiction.</strong><br></p>
    <p style="font-size:75%;">
        Once you have the story written with plot, characters, and a<br>
        overlapping story, go through every line, looking for typos,<br>
        misspellings, grammatical errors, awkward words and expressions,<br>
        and cliches. You can go through looking for a specific thing, like<br>
        spelling errors, and then again for punctuation errors, or try to<br>
        fix everything at once. When finished, your story is now complete!</p>
        <img src="final.PNG" width="555" height="269.25">
    </div>
    
    <div class="colum">
    <p style="font-size:80%; font-family: Arial Black; letter-spacing: 5px"><strong>5) Figure out the basic setting and plot.</strong><br></p>
    <p style="font-size:75%;">
        You need to have a solid sense of what your story’s world is like,<br>
        who lives in the world, and what will happen in your story before<br>
        you start writing full scenes and chapters. If you have a good<br>
        understanding of your characters, which you should have after<br>
        brainstorming, let their personalities and flaws guide your plot.</p>
