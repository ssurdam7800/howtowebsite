    <p style="font-size:80%;"><strong>What is Poetry?</strong><br></p></div>
    <p style="font-size:75%;">
        Poetry (ancient Greek: ποιεω (poieo) = I create) is an<br>
        art form in which human language is used for its aesthetic<br>
        qualities in addition to, or instead of, its notional and<br>
        semantic content. It consists largely of oral or literary<br>
        works in which language is used in a manner that is felt<br>
        by its user and audience to differ from ordinary prose.</p>
</div>
    
<div class="bby">
<h3 style="font-size:90%;">Types of Poetry:</h3>
<p style="font-size:80%;"><strong>Sonnet:</strong><br></p>
    <p style="font-size:75%;">
        A short rhyming poem with 14 lines. The original sonnet<br>
        form was invented in the 13/14th century by Dante and an<br>
        Italian philosopher named Francisco Petrarch. The form<br>
        remained largely unknown until it was found and developed<br>
        by writers such as Shakespeare. Sonnets use iambic meter<br>
        in each line and use line-ending rhymes.</p>

<p style="font-size:80%;"><strong>Limerick:</strong><br></p>
    <p style="font-size:75%;">
    A five-line witty poem with a distinctive rhythm. The first,<br>
        second and fifth lines, the longer lines, rhyme. The third<br>
        and fourth shorter lines rhyme. (A-A-B-B-A).</p>

<p style="font-size:80%;"><strong>Haiku:</strong><br></p>
    <p style="font-size:75%;">
        This ancient form of poem writing is renowned for its small<br>
        size as well as the precise punctuation and syllables needed<br>
        on its three lines. It is of ancient Asian origin. Haiku's<br>
        are composed of 3 lines, each a phrase. The first line<br>
        typically has 5 syllables, second line has 7 and the 3rd<br>
        and last line repeats another 5. In addition there is a<br>
        seasonal reference included.</p>

<p style="font-size:80%;"><strong>Narrative:</strong><br></p>
     <p style="font-size:75%;">
         A narrative poem tells the story of an event in the form of a<br>
         poem. There is a strong sense of narration, characters, and plot.</p>

<p style="font-size:80%;"><strong>Epic:</strong><br></p>
    <p style="font-size:75%;">
        A lengthy narrative poem in grand language celebrating the<br>
        adventures and accomplishments of a legendary or conventional hero.</p>

<p style="font-size:80%;"><strong>Couplet:</strong><br></p>
    <p style="font-size:75%;">
        Two lines of verse which rhyme and form a unit alone or as part<br>
        of a poem</p>

<p style="font-size:80%;"><strong>Free Verse:</strong><br></p>
    <p style="font-size:75%;">
        A Free Verse Poem does not follow any rules. Their creation<br>
        is completely in the hands of the author. Rhyming, syllable<br>
        count, punctuation, number of lines, number of stanzas, and<br>
        line formation can be done however the author wants in order<br>
        to convey the idea. There is no right or wrong way to create<br>
        a Free Verse poem.</p>

    <u><h3 style="letter-spacing: 2px; text-align: center">How to Write Poetry Step By Step</h3></u>
    
     
       <div class="colum">
    <p style="font-size:80%; font-family: Arial Black; letter-spacing: 5px"><strong>2) 
Choose the type of poem you want it to be.</strong><br></p>
    <p style="font-size:75%;">
        Your poem doesn't have to be among an already-set category. Poem<br>
        structure is purely dependent on the poet and the poem itself. As<br>
        a beginner, rhyming poems are basically the best starting point.<br>
        Being arguably the easiest poem structure to master and execute,<br>
        they give the kind of result that will boost you psych to continue<br>
        writing poems..</p>
        <img src="think.PNG" width="555" height="222.5">
    </div>
    
    
    <div class="colum">
    <p style="font-size:80%; font-family: Arial Black; letter-spacing: 5px"><strong>1) Pick a specific theme or idea. </strong><br></p>
    <p style="font-size:75%;">
        You can start your poem by focusing on a specific theme or idea that<br>
        you find fascinating or interesting. Picking a specific theme or idea<br>
        to focus on in the poem can give your poem a clear goal or objective.<br>
        This can make it easier for you to narrow down what images and<br>
        descriptions you are going to use in your poem. For example, you<br>
        may decide to write a poem around the theme of “love and friendship."</p>

    <div class="colum">
    <p style="font-size:80%; font-family: Arial Black; letter-spacing: 5px"><strong>4) Tackle the first line.</strong><br></p>
    <p style="font-size:75%;">
        This is the most important line as it sets the rhythm of your poem,<br>
        as well as being about making a first good impression. The first<br>
        line determines whether your audience (if you're going to perform<br>
        the poem) will listen attentively to the rest of the poem or be put<br>
        off immediately. It has to be interesting or mysterious enough to<br>
        make your reader want to read more. However, it should not be so<br>
        complex that your reader is caused confusion or considers the poem<br>
        too hard to continue with. In other words, the top line has to be<br> catchy.</p>

    <div class="colum">
    <p style="font-size:80%; font-family: Arial Black; letter-spacing: 5px"><strong>3) Be descriptive.</strong><br></p>
    <p style="font-size:75%;">
        Description of an element, object or emotion is a central part of<br> evoking the feeling or depths of a poem. In fact, you could write a<br>
        whole poem just describing something. To help you get started in<br>
        this descriptive process, ask yourself questions. Try using<br>
        descriptive terms relating to colors, motion, depth, temperature,<br>
        and other standard features.<br></p>

    <div class="colum">
    <p style="font-size:80%; font-family: Arial Black; letter-spacing: 5px"><strong>6) Decide when you are finished.</strong><br></p>
    <p style="font-size:75%;">Your little poem is complete. There is no limit as<br>
        to how long a poem is. Some are a mere sentence long, while others are<br>
        paragraphs long or even the length of a tale. It all rests with the poet's<br>
        creativity.</p>

    </div>
    
    <div class="colum">
    <p style="font-size:80%; font-family: Arial Black; letter-spacing: 5px"><strong>5) Write the rest of the poem.</strong><br></p>
    <p style="font-size:75%;">
        Try to think of what else you would like to say about your subject that<br>
        deserves mention in your poem. Then try to make these words fit in to the<br>
        words you came up with in step earlier.</p>
