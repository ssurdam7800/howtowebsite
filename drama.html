    <p style="font-size:80%;"><strong>What is Drama?</strong><br></p></div>
    <p style="font-size:75%;">
        Drama is a mode of fictional representation through dialogue and<br>
        performance. It is one of the literary genres, which is an imitation<br>
        of some action. Drama is also a type of a play written for theater,<br>
        television, radio, and film. In simple words, a drama is a composition<br>
        in verse or prose presenting a story in pantomime or dialogue. It<br>
        contains conflict of characters, particularly the ones who perform<br>
        in front of audience on the stage. The person who writes drama for<br>
        stage directions is known as a “dramatist” or “playwright.”</p>

<h3 style="font-size:90%;">Types of Drama:</h3>
<p style="font-size:80%;"><strong>Comedy:</strong><br></p>
    <p style="font-size:75%;">
        Comedies are lighter in tone than ordinary works, and provide a<br>
        happy conclusion. The intention of dramatists in comedies is<br>
        to make their audience laugh. Hence, they use quaint circumstances,<br>
        unusual characters, and witty remarks.</p>

<p style="font-size:80%;"><strong>Tragedy:</strong><br></p>
    <p style="font-size:75%;">
        Tragic dramas use darker themes, such as disaster, pain, and death.<br>
        Protagonists often have a tragic flaw — a characteristic that<br>
        leads them to their downfall.</p>

<p style="font-size:80%;"><strong>Farce:</strong><br></p>
    <p style="font-size:75%;">
        Generally, a farce is a nonsensical genre of drama, which often<br> overacts or engages slapstick humor.</p>

<p style="font-size:80%;"><strong>Melodrama:</strong><br></p>
     <p style="font-size:75%;">
         Melodrama is an exaggerated drama, which is sensational and<br>
         appeals directly to the senses of the audience. Just like the<br>
         farce, the characters are of a single dimension and simple, or<br>
         may be stereotyped.</p>
        

<p style="font-size:80%;"><strong>Musical Drama:</strong><br></p>
    <p style="font-size:75%;">
        In musical dramas, dramatists not only tell their stories through<br>
        acting and dialogue, but through dance as well as music. Often the<br>
        story may be comedic, though it may also involve serious subjects.</p>

       <div class="colum">
    <p style="font-size:80%; font-family: Arial Black; letter-spacing: 5px"><strong>2) Brainstorm the basic parts of your narrative arc.</strong><br></p>
    <p style="font-size:75%;">
        The narrative arc is the progression of the play through beginning,<br>
        middle, and end. The technical terms for these three parts are<br>
        exposition, rising action, and resolution, and they always come<br>
        in that order. Regardless of how long your play is or how many<br>
        acts you have, a good play will develop all three pieces of this<br>
        puzzle. Taken notes on how you want to flesh each one out before<br>
        sitting down to write your play.</p>

    <p style="font-size:80%; font-family: Arial Black; letter-spacing: 5px"><strong>1) Decide what kind of story you want to tell. </strong><br></p>
    <p style="font-size:75%;">
        Though every story is different, most plays fall into categories<br>
        that help the audience understand how to interpret the relationships<br>
        and events they see. Think about the characters you want to write,<br>
        then consider how you want their stories to unfold. Do they... Have<br>
        to solve a mystery? Go through a series of difficult events in order<br>
        to achieve personal growth? Come of age by transitioning from childlike<br>
        innocence to worldly experience? Go on a journey? Bring order to chaos?<br>
        Overcome a series of obstacles to achieve a goal?</p>

    <div class="colum">
    <p style="font-size:80%; font-family: Arial Black; letter-spacing: 5px"><strong>4) Outline your acts and scenes.</strong><br></p>
    <p style="font-size:75%;">
        You brainstormed your basic ideas about narrative arc, story and plot<br>
        development, and play structure. Now, before sitting down to write the<br>
        play, you should place all these ideas into a neat outline. For each<br>
        act, lay out what happens in each scene. When are important characters<br>
        introduced? How many different scenes do you have, and what<br>
        specifically happens in each scene? Make sure each scene’s events build<br>
        toward the next scene to achieve plot development. When might you need<br>
        set changes? Costume changes?</p>

    <div class="colum">
    <p style="font-size:80%; font-family: Arial Black; letter-spacing: 5px"><strong>3) Develop your story.</strong><br></p>
    <p style="font-size:75%;">
        You can’t deepen the emotional resonance of the plot until you have<br>
        a good story in place. Brainstorm the basic elements of story before<br>
        fleshing them out with your actual writing by answering the following<br>
        questions:Where does your story take place? Who is your protagonist?<br>
        What is the central conflict these characters will have to deal with?<br>
        What is the “inciting incident” that sets off the main action of the<br>
        play and leads up to that central conflict? How is the conflict<br>
        resolved at the end of the story? How does this impact the characters?</p>

    <div class="colum">
    <p style="font-size:80%; font-family: Arial Black; letter-spacing: 5px"><strong>6) Rewrite your draft as many times as needed, and decide when complete.</strong><br></p>
    <p style="font-size:75%;">
        You’re not going to nail your play on the first draft. Even experienced writers need to write<br>
        several drafts of a play before they’re satisfied with the final product. Don’t rush yourself!<br>
        With each pass, add more detail that will help bring your production to life. Even as you’re<br>
        adding detail, remember that the delete key can be your best friend. As Donald Murray says,<br>
        you must “cut what is bad, to reveal what is good.” Remove all dialogue and events that don’t<br>
        add to the emotional resonance of the play.</p>

    <div class="colum">
    <p style="font-size:80%; font-family: Arial Black; letter-spacing: 5px"><strong>5) Flesh out your outline by writing your play.</strong><br></p>
    <p style="font-size:75%;">
        Once you have your outline, you can write your actual play. Just<br>
        get your basic dialogue on the page at first, without worrying<br>
        about how natural the dialogue sounds or how the actors will move<br>
        about the stage and give their performances.</p>
